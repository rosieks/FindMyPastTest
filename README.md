# Coding exercise - prime tables

## How to run it

1. Open FindMyPastTest.sln in Visual Studio 2015 (if you don't have one you can [download](https://www.visualstudio.com/pl-pl/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) VS 2015 Community Edition for free)
2. Press F5 to run

## What I would do with it if I had more time

1. Optimize prime number generator - right know it use very naive implementation
2. Get rid of LINQ in `MultiplicationTableWriter` in order to improve performance, readability and reduce number of memory allocations
